                    <h3>Logan Lindsay - Presidential Candidate</h3>
                    <p>When starting at UC back in the fall of 2016, one thing that became very obvious was the amount of broad opportunities available to students. I instantly knew that I wanted to take advantage of every second and give back to the university in any capacity that I can. I was able to recognize very early in my college career where I could make the most impact, which was through two specific organizations. These organizations were the College of Engineering and Applied Science Tribunal and Undergraduate Student Government. My experience in these organizations made it very clear that every ounce of effort has an immediate and tangible positive impact on the student experience. Witnessing that impact has been the driving force for me to stay involved in Undergraduate Student Government over the past four years and motivates me to continue my involvement into my fifth and final year.</p>

                    <p>I’m no different than any other student who wants to complete their college education, strive towards their dreams and goals, and to watch my ideas and dreams come to fruition. I recognize that there are resources not available for students to accomplish what they set out to achieve, and after many months of research and listening to what students want from their student experience, we have created a well-rounded platform that will address just that. As we reflect on the past 200 years, I see an opportunity to help pave the way for a successful future, which is why I’m running to be your next Student Body President.</p>

                    <p>Let’s fight to the end of our initiatives and goals, so that we can grow as individuals and as a community. Let’s fight to the end of our dreams and ambitions, so that way we reach milestones in our lives. Let’s fight to the end of the collegiate career, so that way we are prepared to tackle the next chapters of our lives. Let’s fight to whatever it may be that we set out to achieve, so that way we leave the University of Cincinnati better than when we arrived. Seek the highest, and never settle. We want to ensure that every Bearcat has the resources they need to grow and thrive, there is no better opportunity to <b>Fight To The Finish.</b></p>

                    <h3>Karl Dierking - Vice-Presidential Candidate</h3>
                    <p>For as long as I can remember, I have been cheering for the Bearcats to <b>Fight to the Finish</b>. Growing up, this meant watching the “Cardiac ‘Cats” on TV and on special occasions traveling to campus to watch games in person.  This didn’t stop me from visiting other schools during my college search, but at the end of the day, I could tell that there was something special about the University of Cincinnati.  As I prepare for my fifth and final year at UC, those lyrics from our fight song have taken on a more personal meaning.</p>
                    <p>Since the fall of 2016, I have realized time and time again that what makes UC so special is the community. Through organizations like ROAR Tour Guides and CEAS Ambassadors, I have had the opportunity to recruit people from all backgrounds to come to this institution. In these organizations, it is my job to give those visiting campus a glimpse into what a day in the life of a Bearcat looks like. I do this by not only speaking from my own experiences but highlighting the amazing things that my peers are doing as well. </p>
                    <p>While I love many parts of the UC experience, I am all too aware that there is still plenty of room for improvement. Over the past couple of years in Student Government, I have worked to improve the student experience and have many more things I still plan to achieve. In my last year at UC, I hope to continue to amplify the voice of my fellow students and assist others as we work to put them in positions where they can enact the change they want to see on campus.</p>

                                    <h4>What is our plan?</h4>
                                    <p>We plan to accomplish this initiative by working with the advising heads in each department as well as pathways advising to create an action plan and then establish a training program to ensure that advisors are prepared to assist students in all circumstances.</p>

                                        We want to embed CAPS counselors in academic colleges and centers so that they are more accessible to students.</p>

                                    <p>Regardless of if you currently utilize CAPS resources or not, this program would benefit students from all over the university. With an embedded CAPS counselor program, increased programming events will be hosted at each college and center to provide more support for each and every student.</p>

                                    <p>We want to create an embedded CAPS counselor program that houses counselors directly into colleges and centers, modeling efforts after peer institutions such as the University of Michigan and UT Austin.</p>

                                    <p>First, we want to create a Bearcat Pantry Delivery Program. This program will allow students to go online or call to schedule a time and location for volunteers to deliver the food directly to you.</p>
                                    <p>Second, we want to extend the days and hours that the Bearcat Pantry is open. We plan to extend the pantry to later in the evening and expand it to the weekends.</p>
                                    <h4>Who does this impact?</h4>
                                    <p>These enhancements would impact students who wish to utilize the Bearcat Pantry and its services, whether that be free food, hygiene items, cleaning supplies, or professional clothing.</p>
                                    <h4>What is our plan?</h4>
                                    <p>We plan to work with Dean Cummins to utilize Bearcat Pantry Volunteers and allow them to deliver food across the university utilizing university vehicles. </p>
                                    <p>Many fraternities and sororities require their members to meet a set number of service hours each year. By working with Fraternity and Sorority Life, we plan to provide more service hour opportunities by extending the hours and days of the pantry. The Bearcat Pantry is very close to many fraternities and sororities making this volunteer opportunity ideal for this community.</p>

                                    <p>Currently, if a student is experiencing housing insecurities, Dean Cummins can assist them by  moving them into an empty campus residence hall owned by the university. Unfortunately, University Housing still charges these students for staying in these empty residence halls.</p>
                                    <p>This initiative would create a fund that University Housing can pull the expenses from rather than charging the students undergoing these housing insecurities. </p>
                                    <p>Many students aren’t aware of this resource provided by Dean Cummins and Student Affairs. We plan to fix that by advertising this resource on the university’s ‘Community Resources’ page and to different centers and colleges.  </p>
                                    <h4>Who does this impact?</h4>
                                    <p>This service would impact any students experiencing housing insecurity throughout their time as a student.</p>
                                    <h4>What is our plan?</h4>
                                    <p>We plan to work with Student Affairs and University Housing to advertise this resource on their respective websites. </p>
                                    <p>We also plan to allocate an appropriate amount from the annual Student Government budget to support this fund. We will then work with Student Affairs and University Housing to ensure that students can anonymously utilize this resource and ease any housing insecurities.</p>
                                    <p>By working with UC Foundation and creating this endowment, people can contribute financially and increase the number of students that this fund will benefit.</p>

Sexual assault and domestic violence advocacy group, Women Helping Women, has partnered with the national ‘It’s On Us’ campaign to provide an all-inclusive bar training program that educates and empowers bar owners, employees, and patrons.</p>
                                    <p>We plan to expand this campaign to more bars and restaurants at the University of Cincinnati to implement these training programs and sexual assault prevention strategies. We plan to join in the fight against sexual assault with the numerous bars that have already completed the training.</p>
                                    <p>The ‘Ask For Lexi’ campaign installs posters in bar and restaurant bathrooms that give patrons the ability to leave an uncomfortable or potentially threatening situation. This campaign is adapted after similar programs such as the ‘Angel Shot Initiative’.</p>

                                    <p>There will still be plenty of food options containing meat in every other dining hall. There will also be a food option with meat in the designated “Meatless Monday” dining hall, but a majority of the dishes will be meat-free.</p>

We recognize that there are many improvements that can still be made and we want to start by taking a look at the plastic waste generated by our “grab n’ go” stations (Catskeller, Quick Mick’s, Victory Parkway Café, Teachers Café, Campus Green Café, Campus View Café, and DAAP Café).</p>
                                    <p>In each of these “grab n’ go” stations, each item is individually cased in plastic. We want to explore and see if there are any other environmentally-friendly alternatives to case these items other than plastic. </p>
                                    <p>We also want to look into alternatives for the plastic straws that are used in these stations and to eliminate the plastic bags used in Market on Main and the UC Bookstore.</p>

                                    <p>Food waste and overcrowded dining halls are common problems at higher education institutions. We plan to combat these issues in a couple ways.</p>
                                    <p>First, at the beginning of the new academic year (fall 2020), we plan to sell to-go containers for students to use throughout the year. These to-go containers will be sold for the first few weeks in dining halls at an affordable price. This will allow students to take food with them and eat where they please instead of staying in the dining hall. At the end of the spring semester, we will then allow students to return these containers and be refunded the full amount, allowing them to be used the next year. This initiative would reduce the amount of disposable containers that go into landfills and incentivize students to utilize reusable containers. We plan to model this program similarly to peer institutions such as Tulane University’s OZZI Program.</p>
                                    <p>Secondly, we plan to utilize the displays in the dining halls to provide students tips and tricks on reducing their food waste. Students are currently being informed about food waste in On The Green’s dish return area, where students are shown how many pounds of food are wasted every day. We plan to expand features like this to all dining halls across the university.</p>
                                    <h4>Who does this impact?</h4>
                                    <p>This initiative would impact mostly first-year students, but would also impact any students that eat in the dining halls. </p>
                                    <p>You would also be eligible to purchase the to-go containers even if you do not have a meal plan and just want the reusable container.</p>
                                    <h4>What is our plan?</h4>
                                    <p>We plan to work with Food Services and Campus Services to create affordable reusable containers, then allow students to purchase them in each of the dining halls.</p>
                                    <p>We will also work with Food Services on what to display on their digital displays in each of the dining halls.</p>
